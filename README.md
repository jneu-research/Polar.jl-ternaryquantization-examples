# Polar.jl-ternaryquantization-examples

This repository contains an example for how to customize [Polar.jl](https://github.com/jneu-research/Polar.jl), a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) implementation of various aspects of [polar codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_code_(coding_theory)).
In the case at hand, [Polar.jl](https://github.com/jneu-research/Polar.jl) was extended to analyze and design ternary quantized polar code decoders.

For more information on this specific use case, check out our paper:

This repository is intended for Julia v1.0 and above.
